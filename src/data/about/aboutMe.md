Hi there ! My name is Laurent Tram, I am a french engineer who is now in a process of changing my career from project engineering into the web development. I decided to start learning web development in september 2019. Since then, I am coding, learning, improving and most importantly enjoying every day in this new field.

I am focusing mainly on the frontend development, with all the technologies related to HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am also currently specializing into the React framework. I also have dipped my toes into the backend world, and I believe understanding the backend will make a better developer in general.

Web development has truly become a passion of mine, writing code has become like my second nature. I am hungry of learning more, master the different languages, and staying up to date with the web development technology.

I am now looking for a junior position in Stockholm as a frontend developer. I will appreciate any job offer that will allow me to continue to learn but also help you build your projects.
