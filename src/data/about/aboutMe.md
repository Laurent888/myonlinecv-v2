Hi there ! My name is Laurent Tram, I am a former french engineer who decided to change career in the summer 2019 to become a great web developer. Since then, I live and breath code, everyday is an opportunity to learn more.
<br/>

I am specialized in React.js as a framework. I have built web applications with React but also mobile application with React Native. I am currently working on a complex  mobile app project with a startup based in Stockholm.
<br/>

Web development has truly become a passion of mine, writing code has become a second nature. I am hungry of learning more, master the different languages, and staying up to date with the web development technology. If you have exciting job opportunities, feel free to contact me !
